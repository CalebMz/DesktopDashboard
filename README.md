# Desktop Dashboard

## Description
This project is an extra project I did to accompany the dashboard app for mobile which was also created using react.js. This dashboard can only be viewed on the desktop 
browser and displays all graphs on a single page as shown below. The dashboard was created using a different graph package and therefore the code had to be written and 
structured differently.
